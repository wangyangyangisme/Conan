Conan 0.9.2 release
-------------------

Bugfixes:
    -There was a problem with conan::priv::BuildSlotData, where a signal->signal
    conection would be processed as a signal->slot connection.


Feature additions:
    -Added a tool button that searches for duplicate signal connections. Such
    connections are marked yellow.

Changes:
    -Added support for Qt 4.5.0
    -Changed the README.txt with information on how to use Conan with a
    commercial edition of Qt


Conan 0.9.4 release
-------------------

Bugfixes:
    -There was a problem with conan::priv::BuildSlotData while processing a
    manually created connection. QSignalSpy and conan::SignalSpy are examples
    of classes that create such connections. They do not have signals or slots
    and are not processed by MOC. Instead they call the internal
    QMetaObject::connect directly.

Feature additions:
    -Added dynamic signal spies. A signal spy monitors the emissions of a
    single signal. Information about each emissions is logged using a
    customizable format.

Changes:
    -Added support for Qt 4.5.1
    -Updated the README.txt and extended the documentation about using Conan in
    /dec/html/index.html


Conan 0.9.5 release
-------------------

Bugfixes:
    -Fixed a problem with deleting multiple signal spies from the sinal spy table.

Changes:
    -Added support for Qt 4.5.2
    -Added project file for use with the Qt Creator IDE and or qmake
